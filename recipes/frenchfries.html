    <h1>French Fries</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      My family loves seasoned fries and with 4 children the bag of fries from
      the store became too expensive. So I tried batter â€” after all, it makes
      chicken, shrimp, and onion rings crispy so why not potatoes! Now even my
      husband can't get enough of these French fries. They even stay crispy when
      you reheat them in the microwave.
    </p>
